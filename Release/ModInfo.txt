Airport CEO Tweaks:

Need to Know for 2.3.x:

* New aircraft types are available via workshop link here: https://bit.ly/aceoplanes
* Mods must incorperate new aircraft in order for them to appear in your save
* You must cancel and resign airline contracts for the fleets to update

Known Issues (2.3.6):

* Game loading sometimes freezes at the very beginning. Restarting clears the issue.
* Game loading hangs on "Loading Game World". New aircraft are being loaded but an indication of this progress is not implimented. Wait.
* Cargo aircraft on small stands depart prematurely.
* Some situations that should fail a turnaround service cause it to succeed anyway. (Is this still true?)
* Reloading the game without quitting to desktop may break the fleets of tweaks airlines.
* Helicopter stands are not correctly colored in the flight planner.


Changelog:

2.3.6 - Expirimental new route generation! Feedback requested!
* Fixed the flight planner bug?
* Aircraft selection for routes now accounts for cargo and non cargo aircraft seperatly
* Aircraft airport restrictions made more permissive
* Updated route generation code to generate a more complete route table sooner after loading a save
* Implimented route caching per-airline to help improbable routes (such as from small countries) generate
* Modified route generation settings to encourage respecting unballanced feet compositions
* Rescaled ground vehicles to better match aircraft scale
* Halved passenger waste generation to help with waste processing bottlenecks
* Unallocated flights are automatically cleared on loading a save; this is suspected to help with flight planner crashes

2.3.5
* ACEO 1.1 compatability

2.3.4
* Fixed an issue with tweaks airlines losing aircraft on save/load

2.3.3
* Implimented RAM saving edits to the code base; credit @humoresque

2.3.2
* Removed incorrectly implimented aircraft rescale code
	* Aircraft pack updated with forced rescales for most relevant aircraft
* Credit @humoresque; added button in the F10 menu to open the log file location

2.3.1
* More refactoring. 
* Back-end functionality to allow multiple new aircraft types to pull from the same sprite sheet.
* Flight Info Panel:
    * Now has hover-over tool-tips for the various service icons. 
        * Credit @humoresque; this was the first real UI code in the project, and was my jumping off point for everything I did since then.
* Planner UI:
    * Airline Containers:
	    * Are slim until hovered over
		* Are sorted: more flights => higher
		    * This sort respects/responds to size filters
		    * Do not appear if no flights matching the current filters exist
	* Flight Containers:
	    * Are sorted: longer flights => higher
		* Are reworked to provide easier to read info
		* List the aircraft type
		* Have more informative tooltips
		* Can be scheduled longer/shorter than previously possible
		* Can be canceled/rejected before being planned by right-click
* Fixes when aircraft pack adds aircraft with more than 2 engines
* Hopefully fixes unintended hard dependency on the aircraft pack

2.3.0
* Added system for importing fully-new aircrafts.
* Added data structure for new aircraft including placeholders for future functionality.
	* (New aircraft are available via separate workshop mod)
* Added an as-of-yet unused system for dynamically rescaling aircraft.
	* Vanilla aircraft are not all to a uniform scale; this system can correct this
* Added data structure for airline behavior modifications.
	* Functionality extends the existing airline.json file
	* Tag airlines as cargo-only
	* Tag airlines to operate only in home country(s)
	* Assign multiple home countries
	* Assign forbidden countries
	* Assign a differnt fleet of aircraft based on tweaks install status (usefull for newly added aircraft)
	* (In Development: assign HUB IATA codes and max ranges from hubs, other hub rules)
* Added data structure to save/load some additional data per each commercial flight. 
	* Save/load utility is credit to humoresque
* Replaced the flight types system with a more robust system.
	* (in the future may be user/modder-definable in json)
* Reworked turnaround service progress tracking to take advantage of the ability to save and load data.
	* Hopefully fixed some bugs with stuck turnarounds and emergency flight turnarounds
	* Aircraft on small stands should not request services that are unavailable to them
* Reworked turnaround time user-interaction and airline interaction.
	* Implements a new aircraft size rule set that will see increasing use in future
	* Consisitent 5-minute jumps on mouse scroll
	* Minimum seperation setting is respected
* Subscribing to more than 50 workshop mods no longer causes mods beyond the 50 oldest to fail to load.
* Patch to ensure cargo aircraft remain on stand now applies only to cargo aircraft.
* Depriciated some old settings.
* Re-factored and reorganized much of the code base.

2.2.x
* Completely rewrote route generation.
* New route generation supports airline nationality.
* Resolved flight planning issue causing skipped flights and hanging confirmation button.
* Implemented basic detection of domestic-only carriers.
* credit humoresque: Tool-tips in flight planner for hold-shift-to-affect-all functionality
* credit humoresque: Structure auto-repair threshold now adjustable in F10 settings
* credit humoresque: ACEO Tweaks version shown below game version

2.1.x
* Fixed airline satisfaction not changing
* Revised version numbering. Conversion: 1.2.1 == (1.)2.1 --- This update can be though of as (1.)2.1.1
* Fixed automatic livery layer un-hiding
* Added "amazon air" cargo airline flag

1.2.1

---It is recommended to disable the auto planner when starting to play with 1.2.1, and enable it only cautiously, one stand at a time. The design goal of the update is that autoplanner is not necessary.---

* Turnaround times depend on type of flight
* Airlines extend flight contracts when satisfied
* Airlines cut short flight contracts when upset
* Airlines operate various flight types based on their economic focus
* Some airline descriptions updated/retconned to match new game mechanics
* Flight types displayed in flight info window, as well as expected PAX vs PAX capacity
* PAX capacity depends on flight type
* PAX load factor depends on time of day
* Fixed some planner bugs from 1.2.0
* Rewrote service request system for baggage, catering, cleaning, fueling, ramp service
* Added setting to disable baggage service on small stands (vanilla behavior is default)
* Added setting to disable baggage service on stands with no baggage bay (improved behavior is default)
* Depreciated settings for experimental flight types and new contract lengths

1.2.0
* Significantly expanded flight variety

1.1.1

* Added "makewindow" command for active liveries
* Added "xact" as shorthand for "exactly"
* Made livery log-spam toggle-able

1.1.0

* UMF auto-update enabled for future updates (pending approval from UMF)
* Improved planner rescheduling logic: more permissive for the player
* Added Flight type framework (not implemented)
* Added Active Livery Components, used for changing previously inaccessible visual features of aircraft

1.0.0

* Added basic cargo system
* Added hold-shift planner enhancements
